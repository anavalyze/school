The short story "Greyhound Tragedy" by Richard Brautigan depicts the failed attempt of a young movie obsessed girl of fulfilling her dream becoming a Hollywood star. Does the story told by Richard Brautigan however depict a tragedy? The following comment will show why this can be said.

One might say the protagonist isn't a noble hero seen in typical tragedies, however, she still has a main goal she wants to achieve and pours everything she has into it and in a way which might not follow the typical structure, she is still the main character of her own tragedy. As stated in the beginning of the story the protagonist she "studied with the zealousness of a doctor of divinity" (l. 16f.) and even going to the bus station can be seen as going beyond her limits, since it is something she is not comfortable with.

Additionally, the main plot of the story clearly has a tragic character, since the one goal the protagonist has is having a dramatic and tragic life, but in the end it becomes everything but that. The girl ends up never leaving her hometown and starting a regular life (ll. 118-121), which is in stark contrast to the eccentric life described in the beginning of the story.

Finally, one could argue that the girl experiences the downfall typical for a protagonist of a tragedy. Throughout the story she gives everything and builds up all the courage she has to go to the bus station, but in the end she still fails to ask for the price. Though this is because of her own anxiety, which isn't exactly an outside influence, her anxiousness still isn't something she chose and has tried everything to fight - it is still outside of her control.

Taking all this into account, the "Greyhound Tragedy" clearly paints a picture of a tragedy, as the name suggests. Even though an atypical one the protagonists is similar to those of classic tragedies who throughout a story with tragic characteristics experiences a downfall, that isn't really in their control.
