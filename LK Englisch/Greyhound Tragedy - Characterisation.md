In the short story "Greyhound tragedy" Richard Brautigan tells the tale of a young movie-obsessed girl struggling to accomplish her dream of becoming a Hollywood-star. The following will be an analysis of the protagonists character and personality.

One of the very first things the author tells us about the unnamed main character, second only to laying out the driving factor of the story, her obsession with movies and dream of becoming a tragic star in them, is her, or rather her father, being financially well of, even though the story takes place during the great depression. This immediately more ore less excludes the possibility of the protagonists difficulty in pursuing her dream is a financial struggle, but rather an internal one, since financial struggle is not only never mentioned, but it is stated that her father is generous with his money towards his daughter, and even throughout his rising dissatisfaction during the story, it is never mentioned that he cuts of or even limits her access to money. Her being financially well off can be directly seen in the second paragraph, "Though it was the Depression, her life was comfortable and untouched, because her father was [...] financially compassionate to his family."(ll. 10-13)

*insert the other 4 paragraphs*

To conclude, the protagonists character can be summarized as ironically quite tragic. On paper she has all the tools to follow her life-long dream, her family is well off and she has seemingly unrestricted access to the money that she needs in the pursuit of her dream, she has a rather romantic personality which can be useful for an actor. She even - in a way - is quite ambitious, but sadly all this isn't enough due to her arguably debilitating anxiety, preassure and expectations to get married and a disinterest in her as a person and her ambition.
