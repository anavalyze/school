Look at the topics that are covered in the cards (there are multiple), and if you feel like certain important knowledge important to the topics isn't covered, you are allowed to create new cards (in total a maximum of 50).

You are also allowed to change the cards that are already there if you think there is a better way to word the questions or a card can be split up into multiple different cards or the other way around.
