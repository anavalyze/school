Sir/Madam,

Recently I came across the transcript of an Interview, titled "Cultural Appropriation: We need to learn to agree in disagreement", between Bernice Brehme and Franziska von Lehel on your website. There are multiple aspects of the interview with which I strongly disagree, and feel spread dangerous sentiment. For this reason I want address these aspects and discuss them in this letter.
